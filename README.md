# Business Quote Generator 

This Javascript Site creates a diffrent quote everytime. With every click on the Button "GENERATE CODE" it calls an api, that gives back an business quote and the author of that quote. The API is created with the tool [Retool.com Api Generator](https://api-generator.retool.com/). The API contains 100 Business Quotes.

You can call the API yourself with this URL:

    curl https://api-generator.retool.com/FI7Umw/data/ 

You can get a specific Quote with this command: 

    curl https://api-generator.retool.com/FI7Umw/data/23 

You can use your command line with **curl** to test the API!

I got all the codes from the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/akhiltak/inspirational-quotes/blob/master/Quotes.csv)

## Things I learned with this project

- creating a api from a csv file 
- calling a api with fetch 
- make a background image responsive
